# Report of my week in Red Hat

### Monday

I think Monday was a great introductiry day and that the teamwork activity helped me learn about Agile even though i already used kanban boards in most projects.


### Tuesday 

I really enjoyed Tuesday because the git activity helped me learn more about how to use it.\
While i had (tried) to use github before it was pretty useless without knowledge about git and this workshop helped in that.\
\
I also really enjoyed the micro:bit programming activity because i like working with limitations and coming up with unique solutions.\
Also seeing visual feedback from my program was 
very motivating.


### Wednesday

While I enjoyed Wednesday's Team-builfing activity, I felt a little lost after a certain point and I wasnt sure what to work on.\
Another thing is that while I know the materials we were given being not so reat for the task was intended, I feel like the activity could have been more egaging if we were given slightly more fitting materials.

### Thursday
