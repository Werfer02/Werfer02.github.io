# Report of my week in Red Hat

### Monday

I think Monday was a great introductory day and that the teamwork activity helped me learn about Agile even though i already used kanban boards for most projects.


### Tuesday 

I really liked Tuesday because the git activity helped me learn more about how to use it.\
While i had (tried) to use github before it was pretty useless without knowledge about git and this workshop helped in that.\
\
I also really enjoyed the micro:bit programming activity because i like working with limitations and coming up with unique solutions.\
Also seeing visual feedback from my program was very motivating.


### Wednesday

While I enjoyed Wednesday's Team-building activity, I felt a little lost after a certain point and I wasnt sure what to work on.\
Another thing is that while I know the materials we were given being not so great for the task was intended, I feel like the activity could have been more engaging if we were given slightly more fitting materials.

### Thursday 

I (obviously) really enjoyed the company funded breakfast fry.\
I also think that the python workshop was very educational as I had little prior experience working on someone else's project / code.

### Friday 

I really liked the car bot programming, especially the communication aspect between the remote microbit and the microbit controlling the car.\
I had thought of similar things before but I never had the chance to actually make and use them, so this was a great learning experience.
While we did not win the race it was still very fun to work on a project like this

Also the free pizza was very nice.


## General impressions / conclusions

Regarding THE question:\
Yes, I think I would like to work in this industry

Throughout this week I was not met with a single task or activity that I could say I didnt enjoy doing.\
Both the working conditions and (from what I know) the work being done seem very interesting to me.\

Overall, I'm greatly satisfied with this experience and I'd love to come back in the future.
