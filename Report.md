# Report of my week in Red Hat

### Monday

I think Monday was a great introductiry day and that the teamwork activity helped me learn about Agile even though i already used kanban boards in most projects.


### Tuesday 

I really enjoyed Tuesday because the activity helped me learn more about git and how to use it.\
While i had (tried) to use github before it was pretty useless without knowledge about git and this workshop helped in that.
